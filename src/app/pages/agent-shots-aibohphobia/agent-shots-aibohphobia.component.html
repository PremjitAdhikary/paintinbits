    A mini-comic set in <em>An Agent</em> universe.  In the first <a target="_blank" 
    href="https://premjitadhikary.github.io/paintinbits/articles/an-agent">comic</a>, the relation 
    between R and agent is shown to be testy at best.  This one continues the same theme.  Both of 
    them are at each other.

    The idea explored in this comic might not appeal to everyone (my daughter was like <em>I don't 
    get it</em>).  But if you write (or ever wrote) code, this should make sense to you!

  <p>
    For R's dialogues, like last time,  I had again requested assistance of my good friend Babin 
    to proof read them.

    <em>Fact:</em>  Palindrome was one of the first programs that I had coded back in my Engineering days 
    (in good old C).
