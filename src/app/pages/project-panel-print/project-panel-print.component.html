    Time for a new rig.  Got myself a desktop this time (after soooo many years).  I have been 
    customising my prize pocessions with my own art wherever possible.  Based on solutions 
    available, I was able to customise.
  </p>
  <p>
    I had customised my first laptop with a <a target="_blank" 
    href="https://premjitadhikary.github.io/paintinbits/articles/project-skin" >skin</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My second laptop customisation was a bit more permanent. I went with  
    <a href="https://premjitadhikary.github.io/paintinbits/articles/project-etch" 
    target="_blank">etching solution</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This time my inspiration was a piece that I had made in 2024.  <a target="_blank" 
    href="https://premjitadhikary.github.io/paintinbits/articles/inner-brahma">Inner Brahma</a>.  
    The lord of creation and imagination.
